# Identifying Chords Research
### Jake D Reeder Capstone Project 2024/2025

## Experiment 1
 This experiment involved plotting sin wave representations of musical chords to compare them and see if they looked similar to one another. The results found that they indeed do, which leads me to believe that a Neural Network may be able to pick up on the patterns of chords of the same type.
